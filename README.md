# CLD_Tet
Calulate CLD for tet. phantoms
Specify organ pairs and their IDs in a separate file, and input by using "-f" option.
An example for paediatric tet. phantoms can be found in paediatric_cld.txt.

Please note the CLD for RBM was also implemented, and as ODD code, 0 should be added at the beginning to note that those IDs are for RBM.
